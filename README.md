### Generative Question Answering Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Generative Question Answering project developed during my internship at Hexaware. The project aims to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries using advanced language models and the Retrieved-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology.

### Features

Utilizes GPT models from OpenAI for generating human-like text responses.
Implements the LangChain framework to integrate external knowledge sources and enhance the accuracy of responses.
Applies the Retrieved-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology to improve response quality and reduce inaccuracies.
Supports retrieval of relevant information from a structured knowledge base.
Enables source referencing to provide transparency and allow users to verify information.

### Installation

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-qa-project.git

Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
### Usage

Preprocess and structure the knowledge base data.
Train the language model using GPT models and fine-tune it on the specific domain.
Implement the retrieval mechanism and integrate it with the generative model.
Enable/disable source referencing as per the requirements.
Test the system with various queries and evaluate the accuracy and relevance of the responses.
