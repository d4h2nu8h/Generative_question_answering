# Generative_question_answering
A Generative question-answering system aims to provide accurate and trustworthy information about Hexaware Technologies by seamlessly integrating with reliable knowledge-base sources by webscraping the entire Hexaware website and adding it to the databases. It uses a language model trained on domains like new GPT models and applies the Retrieved-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology to web-scarred data to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and reduce inaccuracies. It can enable or disable source referencing to access original sources. Data will be gathered from the Hexaware official website, a structured knowledge base will be built, a language model will be trained, response generation and RAG integration will be implemented, and source referencing will be enabled. The solution aims to provide contextually appropriate information about Hexaware.
